# Testing WebGazer.js (22.05.23)
After testing I realized that WebGazer is amazing. The main problem in eye tracking is tracking the Gaze, which is tracking not only the position of your eyes, but rather tracking the direction of your look. This task was highly challenging with the current knowledge, but Webgazer team did almost a perfect work on Gaze Mapping. As I understood they used DL algorithms where they took a dataset of heads and eyes looking somewhere with the given location label, and tested a model on a test  data where head look on some direction. And doing that they developed an architecture that helps to trach your gaze in real time.
